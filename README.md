I am not giving up on this beyatch
I've been working on this thing for awhile.
It still is no good at doing anything.
I am steadily learning along the way though.
Please bear with ya boy.

Beep Man 2 is a javascript-based game to be played in the browser.

This project is hard AF. The things I need to happen in my life, "Everything to click," has not occurred yet. 

My lack of completion is def not due to lack of effort.

I have utilized many sources on the web. 

It is 5 minutes to eleven and I am about to watch the tic hac toe class to see if I get some motivation. 

I have high hopes, but today was a kick in the gut.

It's gonna get better!

forget snow: Let it click, let it click, let it click.


I have the grid. 
What I need to do is:
1. get my players into the starting position
2. create a timer
3. press a button to engage the timer (3...2...1...GO!)
4. make my player move across the grid
5. make the grid squares change color as the players cross them(at first a solid color. I want it to be red to yellow to green to finishline).
6. make my players cross the finish line
7. alert me to the fact that there is a winner
8. annouce who the winner is 

Ok, I totally have to go to bed. It's warming up a little. I'll ask for some instructor/student help tomorrow.
I need it to click like b-legit and fourty water.
